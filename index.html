          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assembled a review board that will be tasked with investigating major national cybersecurity incidents in an effort to “meaningfully improve” the nation’s cyber resilience.</p>
          <p>The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), whose creation was set in motion by a May 2020 executive order signed by President Biden in response to the SolarWinds attack, will be tasked with studying the cause and fallout from major hacks so that the government, industry and security agencies can better protect national networks and infrastructure, according to DHS. The board has been loosely modeled on the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates air crashes, train derailments and other transportation accidents.</p>
